# ATMSpitter Undocumented Sample Analysis

### While gathering new ATM Malware resources for some study time, I came across an undocumented sample of ATMWizX which I got from the [Global ATM Malware Wall](https://atm.cybercrime-tracker.net/index.php?x=stats). Shoutout those guys, they got some real exotic shit.

### What is ATMWizX?

As described by [SecureList](https://securelist.com/atm-pos-malware-landscape-2017-2019/96750/), ATMWizX was discovered in the fall of 2018 and dispenses all cash automatically, starting with the most valuable cassettes.

Considering this sample is "undocumented", I will be looking into ATMWizX and how it works. Lets get started.
