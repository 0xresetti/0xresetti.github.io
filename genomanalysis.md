### Recently, I found someone within the JH Discord (John Hammonds Discord Server), who said they had been infected by some sort of malware that stole all the crypto from his wallet.

### What is a "traffer"?

Before we start, we have to understand the type of actors we are dealing with here, they are known as "traffers":

- "Traffer" - refers to an individual who specializes in trafficking, managing and monetizing malicious online traffic, often involving stealer malware, crypto drainers, and more. Primarily for financial gain.

For more information on these types of teams that work within this area of crypto fraud, see this great article from [@g0njxa on Twitter.](https://trac-labs.com/hearts-stolen-wallets-emptied-insights-into-cryptolove-traffers-team-3f65e84ccebe)

### Analysis of the file itself

After messaging the victim ("_why_so_serious___"), he sent me the link to the "Genom.exe" file he downloaded, this file could also be downloaded from the Discord server that he joined for a supposed "job interview"

It's worthy to note that he was "interviewed" for this job as a "beta tester/moderation job"

This adds up with the key takeaways from @gonjxa's article, mentioning the use of "job listings" to entice crypto users into downloading malware.
