# Genom Crypto Traffer Malware Analysis

### Recently, I found someone within the JH Discord (John Hammonds Discord Server), who said they had been infected by some sort of malware that stole all the crypto from his wallet.

### What is a "traffer"?

Before we start, we have to understand the type of actors we are dealing with here, they are known as "traffers":

- "Traffer" - refers to an individual who specializes in trafficking, managing and monetizing malicious online traffic, often involving stealer malware, crypto drainers, and more. Primarily for financial gain.

For more information on these types of teams that work within this area of crypto fraud, see this great article from [@g0njxa on Twitter.](https://trac-labs.com/hearts-stolen-wallets-emptied-insights-into-cryptolove-traffers-team-3f65e84ccebe)

### How did this happen?

After I messaged the victim ("_why_so_serious___"), he sent me the link to the "Genom.exe" file he downloaded, this file could also be downloaded from the Discord server that he joined for a supposed "job interview"

It's worthy to note that he was "interviewed" for this job as a "beta tester/moderation job"

This adds up with the key takeaways from @gonjxa's article, mentioning the use of "job listings" to entice crypto users into downloading malware.

The Discord server itself is a clone of a real crypto NFT collection known by the same name as "Genom", this is their *real* LinkedIn page:

Their website @ "genom2.com" is offline, their GitBook has been suspended, their Rarible account has been removed and their Twitter account has been suspended.

However, if we go back to the original Discord server screenshot seen above at the start of this article, you will see a different Twitter account ("@genomthegame"), a different website ("genomgame.com"), and a different GitBook page (which has been suspended with the message: "This content has been detected as spam and suspended")

Overall, the current chain of events is the following:

- The victim was looking for a job, and unfortunately found a fake crypto NFT collection that was advertising job listings for "beta tester/moderation job" roles.
- The victim was interviewed in a seemingly "legitimate" interview for the job position. *(After all, who would do a "legitimate" job interview just to steal crypto?)*.. ***sarcasm***
- The victim was directed to their fake website (genomgame.com), which allowed him to sign up and create an account, then allowed him to download the Genom game
- The site redirected to a direct download link which downloaded "Genom.exe"

***(Yes, I know Dropbox link in the screenshot downloads a file called "genom.exe" with no capital "G", this is because the traffers have updated the file since I analysed it)***
