# Uncovering a Palestinian & French Stealer Campaign

### An interesting file was dropped in a Telegram channel I was apart of with the message "i will be using my private stealer for #opisrael, message me to help it spread". This blog shows the world of Stealer-as-a-Service markets, and political hacktivism within Telegram against Israel, and a very noisy piece of malware!

### The Start:

As someone who is very interested in the latest hacking news/malware techniques/threat intelligence/etc, I am in a lot of "underground" Telegram channels, and sometimes, I will come across a new unique malware sample or someone will try and social engineer me into installing malware like my [Reversing a "Game Cheat" Blog](./reversinggamecheat.md)

In this case, it was in the "ℭ0𝔡3𝔅𝔯34𝔨3𝔯𝔰 ANONYMOUS" channel (I know, leave 'em be.. they're having fun) where one of their "leaders" known as "𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐟𝐟" posted a ```gofile.io``` link to a malicious stealer with the caption: "i will be using my private stealer for #opisrael, message me to help it spread".

### The *"Threat Actor"*

Shariff, the one who sent the file, is a TikTok *"Threat Actor"* (heavy emphasis on the quotes) who posts videos related to hacking and the "life" of being a hacker (I think, idk figure it out yourself lol: [https://www.tiktok.com/@s.a.m.i.r_012](https://www.tiktok.com/@s.a.m.i.r_012))

He has a Yemen flag in his TikTok bio, so I believe he resides in Yemen and is supporting Palestine through the Israel v Palestine conflic by spreading malware to any Israeli citizens.
