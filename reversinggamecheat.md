# First blog: Reversing a "Game Cheat" ;)

### One day I was chilling on Telegram, when someone who shared a group with me decided to mass spread some leaked game cheats & other tools! Lets take a look and see if they are what they say they are... 

Now I've never spoken to this person in my life, and at first i just thought it was someone advertising their cheat software and that was all, so I initially responded with how you would respond to any random person who sends you something you dont need:

However, after looking at the website, I recognized it from somewhere, I'm not sure where exactly, but something in my head told me that this was a template that is being used to serve malware instead of actual cheats/tools.

This was when I messaged the guy back saying "wait this is malware isnt it LOL".

After browsing around on the website for a while, I ended up downloading the "COD Warzone ESP Hack" which came in the form of a .RAR file, named "Gloader by Dv9"
